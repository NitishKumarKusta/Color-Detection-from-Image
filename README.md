# Color-Detection-from-Image
Machine Learning Project built using python where the color in a particular place of an image is detected by double clicking on that place.
Colour detection is the process of detecting the name of any color . Human eyes and brains work together to translate light into color . Light receptors that are present in our eyes transmit the signal to the brain . Our brain then recognizes the color. Since childhood, we have mapped certain lights with their color names . We will be using the somewhat same strategy to detect color names. It is not the same strategy that we used to use for computers to detect light names. We used the somewhat similar strategy to use in this case. We detect the names of certain color using the same technique as we have done in the past. 
The Dataset
The dataset used in this project is taken from this link : https://github.com/codebrainz/color-names/blob/master/output/colors.csv
OpenCV, Pandas, and numpy are the Python packages that are necessary for this project in Python.
We need to install them using the pip install command in our terminal.
We need to run the program from the terminal
C:/Users/Desktop>python color_detection.py -i <add your image path here>
  we need to specify the path of the image. Make sure to give an image path using ‘-i’ argument.
  Now to detect the color we need to Double click on the window to know the name of the pixel color.
